        <h2>Hello, I'm Alex.
        </h2>
            I spend most of my days building software.  I gravitate towards mobile work, and enjoy both front and backend development.  I currently work at <a href="http://">Independence Blue Cross</a> <!--live fearless, amiright !--> in Philadelphia, PA where I spend the majority of my time engineering backend and middlewear solutions for their consumer mobile application, which you can find <a href="http://">here</a>.  I also graduated in 2014 from Pennsylvania State University with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.

        </br></br>
            In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects that can be found on my <a href="http://">GitHub</a> account.  These projects tend to focus on work in iOS mobile development and data science / analysis, but they are not necessarily limited to these fields.
        </br></br>
            I strive to understand and be able to work in all areas of the development lifecycle: conception -> initial design -> implementation -> deployment and finally maintainence.
        </br></br>
            Outside of my work in the world of software I enjoy staying active, both playing and watching soccer (COYS!), and a myriad of other interests including but not limited to: writing, music, minimalism, craft beer, and good coffee.  I hope to one day live as a digital nomad and travel as much as possible.

        </br></br>
        As I enjoy both software and writing, I'll ocasionally post write-ups of what I deem interesting in the work I do.  You can find these via my <a href="http://">Essays</a> link here or in my navigation bar at the top of this page.  I'll also include below a relevant sampling of the work I've done below in the section titled <a href="http://">Portfolio</a>.

        </br></br>
        If you're interested in chatting or working with me, feel free to drop me a line via <a href="http://">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://">Email</a>.  I ask that any formal requests for work be sent to me via email.
