        <h2>Hello, I'm Alex.
        </h2>
           I am a software engineer who specializes mobile and web development.  I work in all areas of development, ranging from conception, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.  I'm also fascinated by data science and statistics and enjoy dabbling in these areas in my free time.  Outside of software, I enjoy a myriad of things and love staying active and healthy.

            </br></br>
            I graduated in 2014 from Pennsylvania State University with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.  I gravitate towards mobile platforms, and enjoy both front and backend development.  I currently work at <a href="http://www.ibx.com/index.jsp">Independence Blue Cross</a> in Philadelphia, PA where I spend the majority of my time engineering backend and middlewear solutions for their consumer mobile application, which you can find <a href="http://www.ibx.com/individuals/member_resources/mobile/index.html">here</a>.

            </br></br>
            If you're interested in chatting or working with me, feel free to reach out.  I ask that any formal work requests be sent to me via email.
